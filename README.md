# Exanis

I've decided to create a ASCII RogueLike just as a hobby project.  
For now I don't have any specific plans for it, and I don't know how long
I will take this project.

## How to play

Exanis is actually only dependant on ncurses for now.
To install ncurses type:  
```
sudo apt install libncurses5
```

To play you need to compile from source  
```
git clone https://github.com/pinguxx28/exanis.git
cd exanis
make
./bin/rogue
```
