# Basic Strategy

This is a simple strategy guide for Exanis.

## How to play

You move your character (the '@') with the VI-keys, i.e. hjkl. Gold ('$') and
other items are able to be picked up by pressing the comma (','). When you
find the staircase to decend down ('>') you press the same key to decend ('>').
To fight enemies you 'ram' into them.

### Status bar

All your actions (except movement) will be displayed in the status bar, as
well as actions towards you. The status bar will also display 'the numbers'.

### Stats bar

The stats bar displays statistic about the player, '$' for money, 'HP' for
hit points and 'DMG' for damage.

## About monsters

Bugs are the weakest types of monsters and can be killed in one hit. But there
are often swarms of many bugs and you can't tank all of their weak hits.

Orcs are strong and fast, but they roam the place alone.
