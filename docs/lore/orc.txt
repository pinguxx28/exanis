== THE ORC ==

A scrawny orc, surprisingly small for its kind, slinks in the shadows with an
agile grace. Its emaciated frame is clad in a mishmash of leather scraps,
providing minimal protection but allowing for swift movements. The orc's
sickly green skin is stretched tight over its bony features, and its yellow
eyes gleam with a cunning intelligence that defies its diminutive stature.

Rather than relying on sheer strength, this orc compensates with agility and a
knack for stealth. Armed with a pair of wickedly sharp daggers, it maneuvers
effortlessly through the darkest corners of your world, striking with
unexpected precision.

Don't be fooled by its size; this underdog orc is a crafty and elusive
adversary, ready to outmaneuver and outwit its larger, more imposing foes.
